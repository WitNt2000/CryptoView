    <h1>Privacy Policy for CryptoView</h1>

    <p>
        This application is designed to track cryptocurrency pair prices from exchanges such as Binance, Bitget, and Bybit.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not collect or store any personal information from users.  
        All settings (e.g., update interval) are stored locally on the device using SharedPreferences and are not shared externally.
    </p>

    <h2>Internet Access</h2>
    <p>
        The application requests data from public APIs to display cryptocurrency prices.  
        No personal data is sent during these requests.
    </p>

    <h2>Auto-start on Boot</h2>
    <p>
        To ensure widget functionality, the app uses the RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED permission.  
        This is required to restore scheduled updates after device reboot and does not involve personal data collection.
    </p>

    <h2>Policy Updates</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this privacy policy at any time.  
        Continued use of the application implies acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
